A Quick Introduction to Salesforce
You might think that Salesforce is just a CRM. It stores your customer data, gives you processes to nurture prospective customers, and provides ways to collaborate with people you work with. And it does all those things. But saying that Salesforce is “just a CRM” is like saying a house is just a kitchen. There’s a lot more to it than that.
Salesforce comes with a lot of standard functionality, or out-of-the-box products and features that you can use to run your business. Here are some common things businesses want to do with Salesforce and the features we give you that support those activities. Depending on what your company purchases, you can get these features and more without lifting a finger. But you can almost think of these features as a model house that a real estate agent shows off. You could certainly live there, but it wouldn’t be your home. It wouldn’t have your art on the wall or that unusual coat rack your Aunt Tilda gave you as a housewarming gift.
That’s where the Salesforce platform comes in. With the platform, you can customize and build whatever it is that makes your company unique. And when you have a business application that’s unique to you, everyone is more successful.
