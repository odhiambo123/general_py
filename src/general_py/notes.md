# How to Optimize your Algorithms:
- Looking for Bottlenecks, Unnecessary/redundancy, Repeat/Duplicates. 
  - A bottleneck is that part of code in your algorith that slows down the rest. 
  - Watch out for any unnecessary work and Duplicate work
- Try doing it yourself Naturally 
  - Think through it, naturally you would solve problems quite easily without complicating it too much.
  - take for instance looking through names alphabetized in a stack. you would normally search for Solomon near the end of the stack as compared to Ethan, why wouldn't you apply the same in your algorithm design? 
- Simplify and Generalize
  - Chop down the problem and solve in smaller chunks
- Base Case and Build
  - Solve the base case then walk your way up.
- Data structure brainstorm
  - walk through possible appropriate data structures for the problem and settle for the best.
  - eg:
    - Lists
      - as Stacks
      - as Queues
      - 
    - Arrays
    - Binary tree
- Look for the Best Conceivable runtime
  - 
- using bottom up (a way to avoid recursion) when call stack build up is suspected
- bottom up algorithms start from the beginning
- recursive algorithm starts from the end and works backwards.
